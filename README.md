# Rock-Paper-Scissors
My fourth project on my self taught full stack developer journey.
This project is to demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of Javascript. Through the creation of this game I reinforce my learning of loops, functions and variables to develop a fully functioning rock paper scissors game between the user and the console.

To run this program:
1. Copy the code in java.js
2. Open a new browser tab
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows, Linux) or Command+Shift+J (macOS)
4. Navigate from "Elements" to "Console" on the top 
5. Paste the code, follow the game instructions and enjoy!

*UPDATE*
Added user interface and clicks of buttons to play with computer instead of running solely on console
